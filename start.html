			<br><b>STORYLINE</b><br>
			You are Sephiroth, a student who is trying to pass his math exams by battling his professors. You have a sword called the Derivative, and a gun called the Integral.<br>
			The exams are named after those U.S. senior high school students take, e.g. AP Calculus, SAT II Math, SAT I Math, etc. GIFS are created by BasilStory, a site that<br>
			creates GIFs of MapleStory characters. That site no longer exists. This game was developed as an action game under the parameter that this game be educational. <br>
			<br><b>ITEMS</b><br>
			Headphones will increase your health, and calculators will make your weapons stronger. You may heal any amount of times, but if you heal too much, you might <br>
			take some damage when you heal. Heal only when you have to. You may only attack in the left or right directions, but not up and down. Each calculator has its <br>
			own special ability, be sure to read the item descriptions every time you buy one. <br>
			<br><b>MAP</b><br>
			When you enter, you will be in a classroom. Move your character towards any of the 6 teachers. Beat them in any order; each teacher will get stronger<br>	
			as the game progresses. You will need to defeat all teachers to defeat the BOSS level. <br>
			<br><b>BATTLEFIELD</b><br>
			When you succesfully land an attack on an enemy, solve the math equation that appears from left to right, using Java algebra, disregarding order of operations. <br> 
			(e.g. if you have 2 + 3 / 4 * 5, treat it as the following statements in order: int x = 2; x += 3; x /= 4; x *= 5;) <br>
			Failure to solve the problem will result in damage taken. During this time, you may not upgrade or purchase calculators. <br>
			<br><b>SAVING</b><br>
			Unfortunately, saving is not supported at this time.
